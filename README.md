# Ecosystem-Project
This is a repository for a class project in which we try to model an ecosystem with deer, grass, and trees. This is based on a "foxes-and-rabbits" simulation from the book "Objects First With Java" by David J. Barnes &amp; Michael Kolling.

UPDATE 4.19.2023

At the moment this is just the "foxes-and-rabbits-v2" project but with changes to class names:
- Fox has been changed to Deer
- Rabbit has been changed to Grass
- Abstract class Animal has been changed to Organism
- Variable names have been changed where appropriate to reflect this.
- Dots representing Grass and Deer have had their colors (Grass is appropriately green and Deer is magenta)
